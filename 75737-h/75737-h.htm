    <div>DESULTORY THOUGHTS AND REFLECTIONS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>A profound knowledge of life is the least
enviable of all species of knowledge, because
it can only be acquired by trials that make
us regret the loss of our ignorance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>BEING UNDERSTOOD.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>When we find that we are not liked, we
assert that we are not understood; when probably
the dislike we have excited proceeds
from our being too fully comprehended.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>SACRIFICES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some persons are capable of making great
sacrifices, but few are capable of concealing
how much the effort has cost them; and it is
this concealment that constitutes their value.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MUSIC.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Music often awakens long sleeping echoes
in the soul; and, though never heard before,
seems familiar to the ear, as some voice, loved
in childhood, remembered in a dream.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MINDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some minds may be said to resemble musical
instruments: they possess powers, and if
judiciously touched, give forth sweet sounds.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LOVERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ninon de L’Enclos observes, that “if a man
gives a woman wealth, it is only a proof of
his generosity; but that if he gives her his
time, it is a proof of his love.” This, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>cannot be considered as a conclusive
proof, for, in giving their time, many men
bestow that which is of no value to themselves
or others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Love and enthusiasm are always ridiculous,
when not reciprocated by their objects.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>PATH OF LIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Spontaneously, we render the path of life a
weary one, and plant all the thorns that obstruct
it: while the few stray flowers that
cheer us, arise in some extraneous and contingent
agency.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MINDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The minds of the young resemble new
wine in a state of fermentation and effervescence;
but the minds of the mature resemble
old wine, which has lost its fiery particles, and
retains only its strength and raciness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The knowledge of the world that enables
us to escape from errors, can only be acquired
by an experience which costs us many of our
most cherished illusions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHARACTER OF MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As storm following storm, and wave succeeding
wave, give additional hardness to the
shell that encloses the pearl, so do the storms
and waves of life add force to the character
of man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>PRECOCIOUS WISDOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Precocious wisdom is not desirable for
youth, lest, like the rash blossom which ventures
forth too early, it should be nipped ere
it has strength to resist adversity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>STRENGTH OF MIND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>By relying on our own resources, we acquire
mental strength; but, when we lean on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>others for support, we are like an invalid, who,
having accustomed himself to a crutch, finds
it difficult to walk without one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CONTEMPLATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Contemplation displays to us the past
events of our lives, which, during their occurrence,
we saw not; as a calm clear day
shows us the rocks and wrecks of the sea,
which we discovered not while tossed on the
turbulent surface of the waters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philosophy was a boon bestowed by Reason
to console mankind for the inevitable misfortunes
of life, but being found insufficient
for the task, she granted the blessing of Religion,
a younger, a more gentle, and infallible
consoler.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>POLITENESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A substitute for goodness of heart.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CONSCIENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A starving man, who committed theft, was
asked by a pious person if his conscience had
not cried out to him to forbear. “Alas!” replied
he, “if it did, the cries of my stomach
were so much louder, that they prevented me
from hearing those of conscience.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>PRESENTIMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Presentiments are the heart’s prophecies;
for the heart is a sibyl deeply skilled in all the
mysteries of her own realm.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>YOUTH AND AGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Youth resembles a Claude Lorraine glass,
which imparts to all objects its own beautiful
tints; but age is like a magnifying lens,
which leaves no defect unseen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CONFIDENCES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Confidences are more frequently reposed in
persons through a want of discretion, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>from excess of friendship, and are oftener betrayed
through incontinency of speech than
from motives of treachery.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>COMMON MISTAKES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The common herd of mankind mistake
anarchy for liberty, ostentation for generosity,
passion for love, and vanity for pride; yet
how widely different are they all!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>JUDGMENT OF WOMEN ON MEN.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Women are prone to judge their lovers’ hearts</div>
      <div class='line'>But by their own, which little semblance hath</div>
      <div class='line'>With man’s rough nature. Hence they love them for</div>
      <div class='line'>The qualities they give them—not for those</div>
      <div class='line'>They have, which rarely merit to be loved.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Love in France is a comedy; in England
a tragedy; in Italy an opera seria; and in
Germany a melodrame.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>GRATITUDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Gratitude was fancifully said to be the
memory of the heart; but, alas! for poor human
nature, hearts are more than suspected
to have wondrous short memories.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MEN AND WOMEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A woman’s head is always influenced by
her heart; but a man’s heart is generally influenced
by his head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Life would be as insupportable without the
prospect of death, as it would be without
sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MATURITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is in maturity, when the passions are
calmed, and Reason exerts her influence, that
the attachments we form possess the most stability.
We expect less, and pardon more.
The disappointments we have experienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>teach us to value what we have attained, even
while regretting what we have lost.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE POETRY OF LIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The poetry of our lives is, like our religion,
kept apart from our every-day thoughts; neither
influence us as they ought. We should be
wiser and happier, if, instead of secluding them
in some secret shrine in our hearts, we suffered
their humanising qualities to temper our
habitual words and actions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>HONOUR AND CHASTITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Honour is the peculiar and essential virtue
of men, and chastity that of women; both
are lost, if these qualities are impeached.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Society punishes not the vices of its members,
but their detection; like the Spartans,
who punished the discovery of theft, and not
the crime.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>IDEAS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A man with a vast number of ideas, without
strong power of reasoning, resembles a general
incapable of directing his troops.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>SELFISH MEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The selfish man believes that by closing
his heart against his fellows, and centering in
self every thought and feeling, he escapes
much suffering. But his egotistical calculations
are invariably defeated; for his contracted
sympathies being all directed to one
focus, he so aggravates the ills he endures,
that he expends on self alone more painful
pity than the most enthusiastic philanthropist
devotes to mankind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>ILLUSIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Each illusion that dies gives birth to a posthumous
one, which we believe to be less
perishable than its predecessor, until we see
it similarly fade and expire.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>HAPPINESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Happiness, like youth and health, is rarely
appreciated until it is past.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>SOLITUDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In solitude we retain our own faults; but
in society we superadd those of others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>SEVERITY TO OTHERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some people seem to consider the severity
of their censures on the errors of others as an
atonement for their own.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>YOUTH.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When youth has fled the furrowed brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we no more can trace it now</div>
      <div class='line'>Beaming in every outward part;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where is its refuge?—in the heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, there it dwells more glowing—warm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than when it lent exterior charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeping alive affection’s fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though it no more can love inspire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>HAPPINESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Happiness consists, not in having much,
but in being content with little.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>HATRED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We injure ourselves more than our enemies,
by indulging hatred towards them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MEMORY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From out the grave of every friend we loved</div>
      <div class='line'>Springs up a flower (as fabulists relate</div>
      <div class='line'>Arose from the red stream of Ajax’ wound,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Memory ’tis named, and watered by our tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>It lives and grows, until its fibres strike</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the heart, nor leave it until death.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>AMUSING MEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We never respect those who amuse us,
however we may smile at their comic powers.
A considerable distinction exists between the
amusing and the entertaining man: we laugh
with one, but reflect with the other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>TRUTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Monarchs seldom hear truth until too late
to derive profit from its knowledge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>COURAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Courage defends the honour of man,—modesty
guards that of woman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>BORES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>People who talk of themselves, when you
are thinking only of yourself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>SYMPATHY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Each thought of mine an echo found in his:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our minds were like two mirrors placed on walls</div>
      <div class='line'>Fronting each other, and reflecting back</div>
      <div class='line'>The self-same objects,—such is sympathy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>PLEASURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Pleasure is like a cordial—a little of it is not
injurious, but too much destroys.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>FRIENDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Friends are the thermometers by which
we may judge the temperature of our fortunes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>IDEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ideas are the seeds of thought, but they do
not produce flowers unless the soil where
they are sown is fertile.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>ARISTOCRACY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The aristocracy are prone to ridicule the
elevation of men of the middle class to high
official situations, not reflecting that it is
easier to transmute men of talents into gentlemen
than it is to convert mere gentlemen

  <h2 class='c007'>WANT OF THOUGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“<span lang="fr">J’écrirais assez bien si je savais penser</span>,”
was the confession of a French writer; one
which might with truth be repeated by the

works we find a superfluity of words, and a
paucity of ideas. It is as though they wrote
to avoid thought, instead of revealing and engendering
it. Their works resemble certain
trees, on which is found an abundance of
leaves, but little fruit.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>FORGIVENESS.</h2>

<p class='c008'>Forgiveness of injuries is apt to draw on

reason thus: “If he has forgiven so much, he
can forgive more.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>TRIALS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The spirit in which we receive trials either

<p class='c008'>Knowledge should be acquired gradually,
and by study; for the superficial knowledge
which is the result of the promiscuous and

minor cares of life that weary the temper and
irritate the health; because singly, and in

the collision is likely to excite it into action,

  <h2 class='c007'>WOMEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Women, with their bright imaginations,
tender hearts, and pure minds, create for
themselves idols, on which they lavish their
worship, making their hearts temples, in
which the false god is adored. But, alas!
the object of their best and fondest feelings
generally too soon proves to be of base clay,
instead of pure gold; and though pity would
fain intervene to veil its defects, or even to
cherish it in despite of them, virtue, reason,
and justice combine finally to destroy it; but,
in the deed, too often injure the fane in which
it was enshrined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LIFE.</h2>

another, which is always more easily achieved.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>LIGHT LITERATURE.</h2>

  <h2 class='c007'>DECEIVERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We are born to deceive, or to be deceived.
In one of these classes we must be numbered;
but our self-respect is dependent upon our selection.
The practice of deception generally
secures its own punishment; for callous indeed
must be that mind which is insensible to
its ignominy! But he who has been duped,
is conscious, even in the very moment that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>detects the imposition, of his proud superiority
to one who can stoop to the adoption of so foul
and sorry a course. The really good and high-minded,
therefore, are seldom provoked by the
discovery of deception; though the cunning
and artful resent it, as a humiliating triumph
obtained over them in their own vocations.</p>
